# EEGprocessing
I worked on this project at TUBITAK BILGEM Artificial Intelligence Institute, and my mission was to find patterns in the dataset that were related to the weight-lifting activity. The project aimed to develop a machine learning algorithm that would predict arm movements from brain activity. The project has the possible impact of giving amputees a better range of motion and QOL when using robotic prosthetic arms.

•	I imported and segmented the dataset such that it was possible to process it in MATLAB.
•	I preprocessed the 32-channel EEG data with appropriate signal processing techniques and used Independent Component Analysis to remove eye artifacts in the signals.
•	I then extracted the features I was asked to extract from signals and visualized them using topographical mapping and time-frequency plots.
